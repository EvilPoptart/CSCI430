to add git repo project in windows:


1. add new project (menu->add new->project...)
2. in wizard go to android->Android Project from Existing Code
3. in Root Directory put the path to your local git folder (please use the AnAndroidGame folder)


DO NOT USE THIS FOLDER FOR YOUR WORKSPACE!!!!!!!!

the workspace for ADT has a folder that is computer specific.


for linux/mac good luck (i dont know)
